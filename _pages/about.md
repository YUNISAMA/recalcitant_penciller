<p>We're a group of students, employees, and faculty at the <a href="https://dibs.duke.edu">Duke Institute for Brain Sciences</a> working in psychology, neuroscience, and neurobiology. We hold bi-weekly workshops on the latest developments in statistical methods, programming tools, and professional development practices. After each workshop, we post all of our materials on this website as a resource to anyone looking for help.</p>
