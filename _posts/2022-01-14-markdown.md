# Introduction
It might seem like creating web content is magic, but one tool makes
it easy: markdown. What is markdown? Well, it's a language for
formatting documents using plain old text. So, if you have any
computer with a plain text editor (even something like Notepad), you
can write in Markdown! For live rendering, you can even use online
editors like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io). In this post, we'll
talk about how to write documents like blog posts in markdown. If you
want to make a post on this website, you can either give me your
markdown file, or [post it yourself through
GitHub](https://dibsmethodsmeetings.github.io/magic-of-git/).

Here is an outline of the topics we'll cover. If you're just looking
for a cheatsheet, I would recommend [this awesome
reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

# Formatting text {#formatting-text}
In word processors (like Word or Pages), you use buttons to format
text, and the text appears to you as you formatted it: bolded text is
bolded, and italicized text is italicized. In markdown, however, you
use text annotations for formatting. While your text won't appear
formatted in your editor, it is human-readable, and can easily be
converted into a formatted document like a web page.

{:.bordered-table}
| **Style** | **Markdown** | **Output** |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| italics | `This is some *italicized* text` | This is some *italicized* text |
| bold | `This is some **bold** text` | This is some **bold** text |
| nested bold/italics | `This is some **bold _and_ italicized** text` | This is some **bold _and_ italicized** text |
| all bold/italics | `This is some ***bold and italicized*** text` | This is some ***bold and italicized*** text |
| strikethrough | `This is some ~~bad~~ text` | This is some ~~bad~~ text |
| code | `` This is some `code` `` | This is some `code` |
| link | `This is a [link](https://google.com)` | This is a [link](https://google.com) |
| image | `This is an image: ![alt text](../assets/images/logo.jpg)` | This is an image ![alt text](../assets/images/logo.jpg){: width="25px" } |

<br>

That's it! And if you need anything else (e.g., superscript), you can
always use raw HTML: `x<sup>2</sup>` turns into x<sup>2</sup>.

# Formatting blocks of text {#formatting-blocks}
In addition to basic text formatting, you can also do formatting on
blocks of text. There are two main cases here: quotes and code blocks.

## Block quotes {#block-quotes}
Block quotes are sections of text that you'd like to put in its own
little box. Although they are usually used for quotes, you can use
them whenever. To make a block quote, just put `>` before each line of
text!

Markdown:
```
> This is one, really, really, really, really,
> really, really, really, really, really,
> really, really, really, really, really,
> really long block of text.
```

Output:
> This is one, really, really, really, really,
> really, really, really, really, really,
> really, really, really, really, really,
> really long block of text.

## Code blocks {#code-blocks}
The other main usage for block formatting is when you have code blocks
of any sort. To make a code block, just wrap the code with ```` ```
```` on either side!

Markdown:
````
```
def fibonacci(n):
	""" Compute the nth number in the fibonacci sequence. """
	if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
     else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
 
print([ fibonacci(x) for x in range(10) ])
```
````

Output:
```
def fibonacci(n):
	""" Compute the nth number in the fibonacci sequence. """
	if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
     else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
 
print([ fibonacci(x) for x in range(10) ])
```

If you want to add syntax highlighting, just add the name of the
programming language after the first set of ```` ``` ````'s!

Markdown:
````
```python
def fibonacci(n):
	""" Compute the nth number in the fibonacci sequence. """
	if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
     else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
 
print([ fibonacci(x) for x in range(10) ])
```
````

Output:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
	""" Compute the nth number in the fibonacci sequence. """
	if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
     else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
 
print([ fibonacci(x) for x in range(10) ])
```

# Adding some structure {#structure}
Now that you have all of your text formatted, you might want to add
some structure to your document. Thankfully, this is just as easy as
text formatting.

## Headings {#headings}

Headings are (sub)titles that introduce different sections of your
document, denoted by `#`. They come in six levels of varying size:

Markdown:
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

Output:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6


## Lists {#lists}
There are two types of lists in markdown: unordered and ordered lists.

To make an unordered list, simply use the dash `-` with indentation
for sub-bullets:

Markdown:
```
- first thing
- second thing
  - oh yeah, one more thing
- third thing
```

Output:
- first thing
- second thing
  - oh yeah, one more thing
- third thing

To make an ordered list, you can use digits and periods instead of dashes:

Markdown:
```
1. first thing
2. second thing
   - oh yeah, one more thing
3. third thing
```

Output:
1. first thing
2. second thing
   - oh yeah, one more thing
3. third thing


## Tables {#tables}
Finally, you can make tables using a combination of the pipe character
`|`, dashes `-`, colons `:`, and text. Each line of text represents
one row of the table, and each cell in a row is separated by a pipe
`|`. The first row (after an optional table header) specifies the
alignment of text in the table using dashes and colons: `:---` for
left-, `:---:` for center-, and `---:` for right-aligned (at least
3 dashes, you can use more for padding).

Here's an example of a table with one right-aligned column, one
center-aligned column, and one left-aligned column.

Markdown:
```
|                   Column 1 |        Column 2        | Column 3                  |
| -------------------------: | :--------------------: | :------------------------ |
| this text is right-aligned |  this text is centered | this text is left-aligned |
```

Output:

{:.bordered-table}
|                   Column 1 |        Column 2        | Column 3                  |
| -------------------------: | :--------------------: | :------------------------ |
| this text is right-aligned |  this text is centered | this text is left-aligned |
