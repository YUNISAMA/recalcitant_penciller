This week we talked about the recent paper [*Indices of Effect
Existence and Significance in the Bayesian Framework* by Dominique
Makowski, Mattan S. Ben-Shachar, S. H. Annabel Chen, and Daniel
Lüdecke](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02767/full),
which is a fantastic reference for deciding how to test your
hypotheses with Bayesian statistics. This post is a summary of the
paper, which I definitely recommend to anyone venturing into Bayesian
statistics.

If you already know what most of these things are and you want to know
how to compute them in R, check out the [`bayestestR`
package](https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/index.html),
spearheaded by the same team.

## Introduction

In Frequentist statistics, we try to estimate a single parameter value
that makes the data most likely (i.e., we look for a Maximum
Likelihood Estimate). In this view, the data are random, but the
effects are fixed in that we assume there is a single "correct" value
that we're looking for. To test hypotheses in this framework,
researchers most often use Null Hypothesis Significance Testing
(NHST), in which they calculate a *p*-value, and reject the null
hypothesis if this value is small enough. NHST is widely used because
it is easy to perform, controls for type 1 error rates, and supposedly
gives you a clear-cut answer to your research question given the
data. However, Frequentist NHST has four major problems: (a) it never
allows you to accept the null hypothesis (you can only reject it), (b)
it places emphasis on effect significance, not effect size, (c) it
relies on an arbitrary threshold for significance, and as a result,
(d) it is associated with problems like *p*-hacking, publication bias,
and the replicability crisis.

To remedy some of these issues, many researchers are now moving to
Bayesian statistics, where we estimate a full distribution of possible
parameter values (i.e., a posterior) in contrast to just a single
value. I won't cover Bayesian statistics here, but check out [this
post](https://dukeneuromethods.github.io/bayes/) for a refresher. One
particular advantage of Bayesian statistics is that there are many
ways of quantifying the size or importance of an effect, so we aren't
just stuck with *p*-values. But this blessing is also a curse: since
we have so many different metrics of significance, there is little
agreement about which metrics are best for which purposes, and this
confusion can be a major hurdle for anyone trying to learn Bayesian
statistics for themselves.

<br>
<a id='methods'></a>
## Methods
This paper is geared toward solving this problem: by testing a bunch
of these metrics under a range of conditions, we can see what
properties they have, and decide when to use them. In particular, the
authors simulate linear and logistic regressions, calculate indices of
significance, and compare them to each other.

<a id='indices'></a>
### Indices
Before talking about the simulations themselves, let's introduce the
indices of significance that the authors tested, summarized in this
figure:

</div>

<a id='p-value'></a>
#### Frequentist *p*-Value
As I mentioned before, the Frequentist *p*-value is what researchers
typically use to test hypotheses in psychology and neuroscience. The
*p*-value is the probability $$P(\lvert\theta\rvert \ge
\lvert\hat{\theta}\rvert \; | \; \mathcal{H}_0, \mathcal{I})$$ that we
would observe an statistic $$\theta$$ as big as the one we observed
$$\hat{\theta}$$, given that the null hypothesis $$\mathcal{H}_0$$ is
true and given our testing and stopping intentions $$\mathcal{I}$$
(e.g., the intention to collect 50 data points and to run a single
statistical test). There are a couple things to note here. First,
since the *p*-value *assumes* the null hypothesis, it can not be
interpreted as the probability that the null hypothesis is correct. So
even if $$p = 1$$, you cannot accept the null hypothesis. Second,
since it assumes a set of testing and stopping intentions, you (as a
researcher) are obligated to follow those intentions. So no optional
stopping, *p*-hacking, or anything like that. Finally, *p*-values do
not tell us anything about the size of an effect, only about our
certainty that the effect exists.

<a id='pd'></a>
#### Probability of Direction (*pd*)
Probability of direction is a new Bayesian measure of significance
that is probably the simplest one. *pd* is defined as the probability
that a parameter is strictly positive $$P(\theta > 0 | X)$$ or
strictly negative $$P(\theta < 0 | X)$$, whichever is more likely.  In
other words, it is the proportion of the posterior distribution that
is positive if most of the posterior is positive, or as the proportion
of the posterior distribution that is negative if most of the
posterior is negative. It lies between 50% (where half of the
posterior is positive and half is negative) and 100% (where all of the
posterior is positive or all of it is negative).

<a id='p-map'></a>
#### MAP-based *p*-Value (*p*-MAP)
The MAP-based *p*-value is a Bayesian measure intended to resemble the
Frequentist *p*-value, defined as the odds that the parameter has
against the null hypothesis. It is the ratio $$P(\theta = 0) /
P(\theta = MAP)$$ of the posterior probability that the parameter
equals 0 (or some other null value of interest) divided by the
posterior probability that the parameter is equal to the maximum a
posteriori (or most likely) value. Here a value of 0 means that the
null hypothesis is impossible (i.e., the parameter cannot be 0) and a
value of 1 means that the null hypothesis is most likely (i.e., the
posterior mode is at 0).

<a id='rope'></a>
#### Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE)
The Region of Practical Equivalence assumes that there is a range of
parameter values (called the ROPE) that are so small, they might as
well be considered as *practically equivalent* to zero. To define this
range, it is common to use a standardized effect size of [-.1, .1],
which is usually considered a negligible effect size. Once we have the
ROPE, we can simply check how much of the posterior lies within that
range: ROPE (full) = $$P(-ROPE \le \theta \le ROPE)$$. When this
probability is 0, we can say that the effect is significant (since the
parameter lies entirely outside of the null region). When it is 1, we
can say that the parameter is practically equivalent to 0 (since all
of the posterior lies inside the null region).

Some argue that this over-weights parameter values that are extremely
unlikely, and so we should exclude them from this proportion. To do
so, we simply condition that the parameter lies within some highest
density interval (HDI), such as the 95% HDI: ROPE (HDI) = $$P(-ROPE
\le \theta \le ROPE \; | \; lowerHDI \le \theta \le upperHDI)$$. Both
versions are essentially the same, but ROPE (full) considers the
entire posterior, whereas ROPE (HDI) considers only the most probable
values. This has the effect of making the ROPE values more robust at
the cost of being less sensitive, where choosing an HDI close to 100%
prefers sensitivity and choosing smaller HDIs favors robustness.

<a id='bf'></a>
#### Bayes Factor (BF)
For better or for worse, the Bayes Factor is probably the most
well-known and most widely-used Bayesian metrics of
significance. Bayes' rule tells us that to get the posterior
probability $$P(\mathcal{H} \; | \; \mathcal{D})$$ of a hypothesis
$$\mathcal{H}$$ given the data $$\mathcal{D}$$, we need to start with
a prior probability $$P(\mathcal{H})$$, and multiply by the likelihood
of the data given the hypothesis, normalized by the probability of the data:

<br>

$$P(\mathcal{H} \; | \; \mathcal{D}) = \frac{P(\mathcal{D} \; | \; \mathcal{H})P(\mathcal{H})}{P(\mathcal{D})}$$

<br>

When we want to compare two hypotheses $$\mathcal{H}_0$$ and
$$\mathcal{H}_a$$, we can just take the ratio of their posterior
probabilities, known as the *posterior odds* (note that the
$$P(\mathcal{D})$$s cancel out):

<br>

$$\begin{alignat}{2}
posterior \; odds &= \quad\quad BF \; &&* \; prior\; odds \\
\frac{P(\mathcal{H_0} \; | \; \mathcal{D})}{P(\mathcal{H_a} \; | \; \mathcal{D})}
&= \frac{P(\mathcal{D} \; | \; \mathcal{H_0})}{P(\mathcal{D} \; | \; \mathcal{H_a})} \; &&* \; \frac{P(\mathcal{H}_0)}{P(\mathcal{H}_a)} \\
\end{alignat}$$

<br>

So the posterior odds break apart into the BF, which is just the
likeliihood ratio, and the prior odds, which specify the extent to
which we initially trust $$\mathcal{H}_0$$ over
$$\mathcal{H}_a$$. Usually we don't prefer one hypothesis over the
other *a priori*, so this ratio is just 1, and the posterior odds are
just the BF.

Just like how there are two versions of the ROPE, there are also two
possible versions of the BF for testing against a null
hypothesis. When the null hypothesis is that $$\theta = 0$$ (i.e., a
point-null), the BF tells us whether our belief that $$\theta = 0$$
has increased (BF > 1) or decreased (BF < 1). But we can also choose a
null hypothesis that $$-ROPE \le \theta \le ROPE$$, where $$ROPE$$ is
some small value we consider to be practically equivalent to
zero. Then the BF tells us whether our belief that $$\theta$$ lies in
this range has increased or decreased after seeing the data.

<a id='simulation'></a>
### Simulation
Now that we know what each of the measures are, how do we compare
them? Easy: we simulate some data, and calculate them! In this case,
the authors simulated data for linear and logistic regression with a
pre-defined ground-truth presence or absence of an effect, a
pre-defined sample size, and a pre-defined noise level. Varying each
of these factors, they made 36,000 datasets in total, and calculated
each of the above metrics over the corresponding linear/logistic
regression.

<br>
<a id='results'></a>
## Results
To compare each of the measures, the authors looked at the impact of
sample size on each measure, the impact of noise, the relationship
with the Frequentist *p*-value, and the relationship between the
measures.

<a id='sample-size'></a>
### Impact of Sample Size

As you can see below, the measures exhibit two overall patterns.

The Frequentist *p*-value, *pd*, and *p*-MAP all indicate increasing
significance with increasing sample size when there truly is an effect
to be detected. However, when the null hypothesis is true, these
measures show no relationship with sample size.

On the other hand, both the ROPE and the BF seem to be influenced by
sample size regardless of whether the null hypothesis is true or
false. When the $$\mathcal{H}_0$$ is true, they show a higher
preference for the null over the alternate hypothesis with larger
samples. In contrast, when the null is false, they show a greater
preference for the alternative hypothesis with larger samples. There
also doesn't seem to be a big difference between the two ROPEs or
between the two BFs.

</div>


<a id='noise'></a>
### Impact of Noise

Unlike the impact of sample size, all of the measures seem to be
similarly impacted by noise in the predictor variable- the more noise,
the less "significant" of a result. However, while most of the
measures seem to have more variability in the presence of noise, the
BF has less variability with increasing noise (indicating a
convergence on the null hypothesis).

</div>

<a id='rel-p-value'></a>
### Relationship with *p*-value
As you can probably tell at this point, *pd* and *p*-MAP are strongly
related to the Frequentist *p*-value, whereas the ROPE and BF are not
trivially related to the *p*-value. While *p*-MAP has a curvilinear
relationship to the *p*-value, *pd* is approximately linearly related
through the following formula: $$p_{two-tailed} = 2(1 - pd)$$. This
implies that *pd* is probably a nice thing to report to the pesky
reviewer demanding *p*-values.

</div>

<a id='rope-pd-bf'></a>
### Relationship Between ROPE (full), *pd*, and *BF* (vs. ROPE)
Finally, the authors investigated the relationships between the BF,
the ROPE, and *pd* (which as we saw directly corresponds to
*p*-values). The left two plots show that both the BF and the ROPE are
related to *pd*, but these relationships are modulated by sample
size. On the right, we can see that the BF and ROPE measures are
directly related, but that this relationship depends on the type of
the model being tested (linear or logistic).

<a id='discussion'></a>
## Discussion
Overall, the authors concluded that it seems like these measures break
down into two families, which each indicate separate things.

1. The *p*-value, *pd*, and *p*-MAP all seem to indicate the existence of
an effect. When a true effect exists, they are related to sample size,
but when no effect exists, they don't carry any information at all. So
these measures can be interpreted as one's certainty that an effect
exists (or not).

2. The BF and the ROPE, on the other hand, seem to truly indicate the
significance of an effect in the common sense of the word (i.e.,
effect size or importance). These two measures care about both the
presence and the absence of an effect.

Because of this division, the authors recommend adopting an
existence-significance framework in which you interpret the measures
accordingly.

<a id='reporting-guidelines'></a>
### Reporting Guidelines
The tldr version of this post is that some measures (*p*, *pd*, and
*p*-MAP) indicate the existence of an effect and others (BF, ROPE) the
significance. So, it's best to report (at least) one measure from each
category. In terms of existence, *pd* is probably the best measure to
report because it's easy to interpret and because it directly
corresponds to the well-known but misunderstood *p*-value. To report
significance, the authors recommend using BF (vs ROPE) when you have
informative priors (since the BF is influenced by prior information),
and to use the ROPE (full) when you don't (since the ROPE is pretty
much constant under any not-super-informative prior). Of course none
of these measures are perfect or good for everything, so you consult
the table below for a nice summary. 

I found this paper to be incredibly useful in reporting my own
analyses and interpreting my results. If you're relatively new to
Bayesian stats, hopefully this encouraged you to try it out!
